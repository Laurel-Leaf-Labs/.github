# **Project Purpose: AI-Driven Visual Servoing for Interactive Communication**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered interactive communication system** that utilizes **computer vision, motor control, and visual servoing** to interpret human hand gestures and control a motorized camera system. The system is divided into two interconnected components:  

1. **Master System**:  
   - Captures and tracks human hand movements using a camera.  
   - Uses AI-based gesture recognition to infer motion commands.  
   - Sends movement commands to the slave system.  

2. **Slave System**:  
   - Receives motion commands from the master system.  
   - Controls a motor that adjusts the cameraâ€™s position accordingly.  
   - Detects and identifies objects in the scene.  

This setup enables seamless, real-time interaction between a human operator and a remote-controlled camera system, with applications in **robotics, assistive technology, and human-machine interaction**.
